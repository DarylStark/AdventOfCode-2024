# Advent of Code 2024 - Python

This is my repository with the code for the Advent of Code 2024. I will be using Python for all the challenges in this repository.

## How to run the code

Make sure you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed. Use the following commands to run the code:

```bash
uv sync
uv run aoc24
```
